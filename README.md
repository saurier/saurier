<h2 align="center">✨Hi✨<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGrHErakgV8GRO0/giphy.gif" width=30></h2>

I'm Alena. <br>
For now, I hold a master's degree in computer science. When developing various projects, I use many different technologies. 
This helps me to quickly understand new concepts. Studying technical specialties at a university has cultivated my skills by constantly challenging me to learn from scratch.
For now I'm just learning, but I want to know developing from different angles.

For more information about me, check out links below. Feel free to contact me. I am always here. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/My-LinkedIn-blue)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kryzhanivskaolena)
